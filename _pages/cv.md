#### Work Experience
- **[General Atomics Aeronautical Systems] - Reliability, Availability, and Maintainability/ System Safety Engineering Intern**  
  [June, 2025] - [August, 2025]  
  - Led a project independently for Mean Time To Repair calculations for a new Unmanned Aerial Vehicle  model, providing valuable data that assisted in the re-design of the model itself considering the time it would take to repair individual parts
  - Worked on several projects that included Mean Time Between Failure and Mean Time To Repair calculations for different models of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, both for internal efficiency analysis and for client quarterly reports
  - Worked with Excel spreadsheets to produce several quarterly reports that included both financial and analytical data concerning aircraft failure, including creating a top-ten most failed line replaceable unit table that involved a variety of failure metrics and graph generation for the government of France and the United States Air Force
  - Performed Discrepancy-ID classification, analyzing descriptive statistics involving specific failure instances and classifying each failure for the United States Air Force, assisting in their analysis of mission success
  - Designed code in Excel that automated a recurring issue involving the elimination of repeating values, increasing the efficiency of the department by reducing 10 hours of manual labor per quarter
 
- **[Cornell Electric Vehicles Project Team] - Mechanical Subteam/ Drivetrain Subsystem Member**  
  [October, 2023] - Present
  - Collaborate with a project team of 75+ members with a goal of designing an energy efficient electric vehicle
  - Own design, analysis, and manufacturing of the driveshaft, which interfaces with every component in the drivetrain. Doubled driveshaft length from last year to accommodate new drivetrain architecture. Analyzed stress concentrations in ANSYS, using results to inform material selection
  - Operate several machines including the Lathe and Mill to fabricate several components specific to the drivetrain, including a trak lathe for machining the driveshaft


- **[Cornell Physics 1101 Staff Member] - Tutor / TA**  
  [October, 2023] - Present
 - Spent 6+ hr/week teaching and tutoring students about mechanics in Fall and electromagnetism in Spring to 100+ students
 - Attended weekly meetings to address different modes of teaching and problem solving as well as furthering fundamental knowledge on physics
