## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/AMB.Headshot.png" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is Alexis Barrow, and I am currently a junior studying Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Aerospace Engineering. At Cornell, I spend most of my time with my project team, Cornell Electric Vehicles, assisting in building a drivetrain subsystem for our self-built electric car. Last summer, I interned as a Reliability, Availability, Maintainability, and System Safety Engineering Intern at General Atomics Aeronautical Systems.
