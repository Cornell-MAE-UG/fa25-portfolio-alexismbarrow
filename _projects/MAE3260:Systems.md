As a part of my System Dynamics class, we had to choose a system, analyze it, and model it. Our project involved the modelling of a 2-link robot arm. The arm has 2 servos, one attached to the base and the other connected at the joint, each driving each part of the arm individually. The input to the system was the angles to the horizontal for either arm. Aspects studied specifically include ODEs, transfer functions, block diagrams, and feedback control law.

Enclosed below is a PDF the final project report.
