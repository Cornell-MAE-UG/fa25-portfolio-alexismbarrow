At my internship this past summer, with General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, I was placed in charge of my own project to handle the Mean Time To Repair calculations for a new Unmanned Aerial Vehicle that was in development for the United States Air Force. Being in charge meant I worked on this project completely independently, only outsourcing to other departments when necessary. Working on this project included analyzing technical drawings, utilizing data concerning repair with similar aircrafts within General Atomics, and going to the area where the first iterations of the aircraft was being constructed to analyze the accessibility of the different working Line Replaceable Units. My project's completion was vital to the completion of the aircraft as a whole, and I was able to finish even earlier than the initial deadline that had been expected due to working hard, communicating effectively, and careful organization.

I worked on multiple other projects involving the calculation of Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) and Mean Time To Repair for various models of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), supporting both internal efficiency assessments and client-facing quarterly reliability reports. Using Excel, I formatted and generated detailed reports that combined financial and analytical data on aircraft performance and failure trends. This included developing a “Top-Ten Most Failed Line Replaceable Units (LRUs)” analysis, incorporating a range of failure metrics and graphical data representations. 



Another project I worked towards was performing  Discrepancy Identification (ID) classification by analyzing descriptive statistics for individual failure events and categorizing each according to failure type and root cause to enhance reliability insights and maintenance planning.
