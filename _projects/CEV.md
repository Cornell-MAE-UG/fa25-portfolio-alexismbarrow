I collaborate with a project team of over 75 members at Cornell University to design and build the world’s most energy-efficient, level-2 autonomous electric vehicle. My main responsibility has been the design, interfacing, and machining of the driveshaft. I work closely with other members to ensure my part fits properly and is able to handle all possible load cases, as well as select all necssary bearings and other additional components.

My work involves performing detailed force calculations under various load cases, conducting both physical and simulation-based safety testing using ANSYS, and contributing to motor selection through analysis of prior performance data and design calculations.

In addition to analytical work, I operate machining equipment such as lathes and mills to fabricate drivetrain components, including machining the driveshaft on a TRAK lathe. I also use CAD software to design and model drivetrain elements, ensuring precision and integration within the overall vehicle system.
