For our fluids final project, we were given a mechanical device to dissect and analyze, a hedge trimmer. We took this mechanical device apart piece by piece with a variety of different tools, and kept track of the interfacing between parts. Using our knowledge from fluids and online resources, we analyzed the hedge trimmer, focusing specifically on the fluid mechancial devices within it. Finally, we recorded a video breaking down our analysis of the device, noting specifically our thoughts on efficiency and explaining the fluid mechanical devices invovled in the system.

My contribution for the dissection included primarily photo and video taking as well as unscrewing the fasteners on the hedge trimmer. I worked to dissect the machine physically, and recorded the different parts as they came off of the machine. This included problem-solving involving the various tools needed to dissect the part, and deciding which order was best for the most accurate analysis. For the video, I worked on the analysis of the interfacing for the hedge trimmer, and assisted in the making of the slides. I worked on the identification and analysis of the various fluid mechanical devices as well. I also wrote the script for and narrated the video uploaded.
